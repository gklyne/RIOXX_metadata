It is RECOMMENDED that the source is referenced using a unique identifier from a recognised system e.g. the unique 8-digit International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN) assigned to electronic periodicals, or the 13 digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN13) assigned to books. In the latter case, the ISBN13 for the electronic verison of the book SHOULD be used if available.\r\n\r\nUse of this element is applicable where the resource is to be published as part of a larger resource. Examples might include a journal article, a conference paper or a chapter of a book, but not a complete book for example.",
