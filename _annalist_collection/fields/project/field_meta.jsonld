In cases where the resource has been funded internally, an appropriate internal code might be used.\r\n\r\nThe element takes two attributes, funder_name and funder_id. One or both of funder_name and funder_id MUST be supplied.\r\n\r\nfunder_name\r\n\r\nThe canonical name of the entity responsible for funding the resource SHOULD be recorded here as text.\r\n\r\nfunder_id\r\n\r\nA globally unique identifier for the funder of the resource SHOULD be recorded here. An HTTP URI MUST be used for this. It is RECOMMENDED that one of the following identifier schemes is used:\r\n\r\nan ISNI ID\r\na DOI (in its HTTP URI form) made available by FundRef\r\nExample\r\n\r\n    <rioxxterms:project\r\n        funder_name=\"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\"\r\n        funder_id=\"http://isni.org/isni/0000000403948681\"\r\n    >\r\n        EP/K023195/1\r\n    </rioxxterms:project>\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    <rioxxterms:project\r\n        funder_name=\"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\"\r\n        funder_id=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266\"\r\n    >\r\n        EP/K023195/1\r\n    </rioxxterms:project>\r\n\r\nWhere the resource has been funded by more than one funder a separate rioxxterms:project element MUST be added for each. Similarly, where several project IDs provided by the same funder have been attached to the resource, a separate rioxxterms:project element MUST be added for each.\r\n\r\nThis means that it is quite normal for a given funder_name, funder_id or project_id to appear in multiple instances of the rioxxterms:project element in a single RIOXX metadata record.",
