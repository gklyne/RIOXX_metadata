  "rdfs:comment": "Use of this element is: Mandatory \r\n\r\nThe author of the resource may be a person, organisation or service, but is most commonly a person. This element SHOULD take an optional attribute called id, which MUST contain an HTTP URI which uniquely identifies the author. Where there is more than one author, a separate rioxxterms:author element MUST be used for each. As many authors may be entered as required. The ideal use of this element is to include both an HTTP URI in the id attribute, and a text string in the body of the element, thus:\r\n\r\n    <rioxxterms:author id=\"http-uri-for-this-author-entity\">\r\n        name-of-this-author-entity\r\n    </rioxxterms:author>\r\n\r\nWhere the author is a person, the RECOMMENDED format is to add text in the form Last Name, First Name(s), and to include an ORCID ID, if known, in its HTTP URI form, e.g.\r\n\r\n    <rioxxterms:author id=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1395-3092\">\r\n        Lawson, Gerald\r\n    </rioxxterms:author>\r\n\r\nWhere the author is an organisation, the RECOMMENDED format is to add the official name of the organisation, and to include an ISNI ID, if known, in its HTTP URI form, e.g.\r\n\r\n    <rioxxterms:author id=\"http://isni.org/isni/0000000419367988\">\r\n        University of Edinburgh\r\n    </rioxxterms:author>\r\n\r\nWhere the rioxxterms:author element appears multiple times for one record, it CAN be assumed that the order is significant, in that the first element describes the 'first named author' of the resource. In order to make this more explicit, an extra attribute, first-named-author, SHOULD be used to indicate which of the rioxxterms:author elements describes the first named author of the resource, thus:\r\n\r\n    <rioxxterms:author id=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1395-3092\" first-named-author=\"true\">\r\n        Lawson, Gerald\r\n    </rioxxterms:author>\r\n",
