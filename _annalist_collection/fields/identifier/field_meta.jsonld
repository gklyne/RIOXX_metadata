The purpose of this field is, through direct identification of the resource, to allow access to it, therefore it is RECOMMENDED that this identifier should point to the actual resource being described by the RIOXX record (typically a file in MS Word or PDF format), rather than to an intermediary resource such as a repository web page. Note that RIOXX does not require any require particular file format to be used for the resource.\r\n\r\nTo describe another version of the resource with a different identifier, a completely separate RIOXX record should be created.",
